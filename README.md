Last project! I know there's a lot for me to learn still but it's really cool to see the progression of my dev skills.
Anyway, this project is a Spotify Clone. The main front end is built so the user can search songs, by charts, or by "biggest hits".
I used an assets folder for the images, and song files for this project. I also created a admin page for users to upload their songs from their computer to add to a playlist but I wasn't able to finish that and I couldn't figure out the backend for that functionality. I think I focused to much on trying too many front end things, and the backend fell short. Also, I wasn't able to figure out how to deploy my website on Netlify, but I will link it below.

Thank you for taking a look at this, and thank you for all of your time in class, teaching us students and helping us out. It has been really fun, and it's an experience I will never forget!

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
